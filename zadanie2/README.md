### Task 2 
if I manage to do it I'll receive better grade<br>
soo...

dy / dt = (1-2y)y^2  

y(0) = 1

t ∈ 〈0,5〉 

solve using Rungego-Kutty method (4'th degree)

Present the solution graphically with the integration step h = 0.5

Next do the same using different integration steps

Full task can be found [here](Projekt2-MetNum.pdf) (I have to do the second one)

The [main_zuza.cpp](main_zuza.cpp) is complete and working answer to my task.

I have collected some 



```RK4 method {y'[x] = (1 − 2*x)*x*x , y[0] == 1} from 0 to 5 stepsize = 0.5```
